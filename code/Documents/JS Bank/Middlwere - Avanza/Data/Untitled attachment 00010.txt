Subject: Weekly Project Status Update Report and Meeting 

  

Dear Burhan, 

Going forward, we would require a weekly update on the "status" of the
project, especially highlighting the following elements: 
1.        Time line achievements; delay and their reasons; efforts to
maintain the agreed schedule; 
1.        Any open issues, that require closure 
1.        Queries that require clarification from the bank or other partners




I would appreciate if you could prepare a weekly update report on the same,
send this out on email every Thursday evening, and then present the same
with your team on every Friday at 11:00am (1 hour duration total). 

I look forward to the first report today, and then the call tomorrow
morning, 13th June 2014. 


Regards, 
Akbar
